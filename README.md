# SpaceNews API
Your Space News API!

## The Project
This is a simple project made using Node.js, Express and MongoDB to create a API that providers static news about the space! Feel free to use in your projects.

## The Problem
I've made this project just because i needed some Space News for my landing page (check <a href="astrohub.vercel.app">AstroHub</a>). I tried to search some real time news api, but a encounter one problem: all the News Apis i've found are paid, and I don't want to spend much money in a simple academic project. Because that, I think in build my own news api, and I here it was!
.
## TO DO
- Create a generic news api and transform this project in a endpoint.
